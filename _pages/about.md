About me
======
I am Ikerbasque Research Professor at <a href="https://www.ikerbasque.net/">Ikerbasque -- Basque Foundation for Science</a> and Distinguished Researcher at the <a href="https://ehu.eus/">University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU</a>, where I am the PI of the consolidated research group <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gtabilbao/">``Groups, Topology and Applications''</a> of the Basque Government.
						
My research is in combinatorial and geometric group theory and Diophantine geometry over groups, as well as their interactions with Model Theory. Most recently, the focus of my research are higher dimensional generalisations of real trees and graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups and generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups.

All my papers are available on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Kazachkov%2C+I">arXiv</a>. You can find a working draft of the paper <a href="https://www.wescac.net/cones.html">Real cubings and asymptotic cones of hierarchically hyperbolic groups</a>, which is joint work with <a href="https://montsecasals.wixsite.com/montse">Montserrat Casals-Ruiz</a> and <a href="https://www.wescac.net/">Mark Hagen</a>. You can find my recent papers on graphs of groups with cyclic edges and generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups <a href="https://ilyakazachkov.github.io/GBS/">here</a> and also on <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Kazachkov%2C+I">arXiv</a>. This is joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dario-ascari">Dario Ascari</a> and <a href="https://montsecasals.wixsite.com/montse">Montserrat Casals-Ruiz</a> .
						
Before moving to Spain, I was a <a href="https://royalcommission1851.org/fellowships/research-fellowships">Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, where I also was a Fellow of <a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/">Wolfson College</a>.
