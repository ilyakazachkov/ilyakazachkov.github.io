About me
======
I am an Ikerbasque Research Professor at Ikerbasque -- Basque Foundation for Science and Distinguished Researcher at the <a href="https://ehu.eus/">University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU</a>, where I am the PI of the consolidated research group ``Groups, Topology and Applications'' of the Basque Government.
						
My research is in combinatorial and geometric group theory and Diophantine geometry over groups. I am also interested in Model Theory. Most recently, the focus of my research are higher dimensional generalisations of real trees, which we call real cubings and graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups and generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups.
						
Before moving to Spain, I was a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellow at the University of Oxford
