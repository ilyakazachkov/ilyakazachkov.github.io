Together with <a href="https://montsecasals.wixsite.com/montse" target="_blank">Montserrat Casals-Ruiz</a>  and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dario-ascari" target="_blank">Dario Ascari</a> we study graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups, their group of automorsphims as well as the Isomorphism Problem including the Isomorphism Problem for GBSs.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
We describe the outer automorphism group of a one-ended fundamental group of a graph of groups, when edge groups are cyclic, and vertex groups are torsion-free with cyclic centralizers. We show that in this case the outer automorphism group is virtually built from the outer automorphisms of the vertex groups (fixing some elements), the outer automorphisms of some associated generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups, and generalized twists - partial conjugations by elements in the centralizers of some elliptic elements in the group.

<a href="http://ilyakazachkov.github.io/files/GBS1.pdf" target="_blank">On the isomorphism problem for cyclic JSJ decompositions: vertex elimination</a>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> 
 We introduce two new moves on graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups that preserve the fundamental group. These moves allow us to address the isomorphism problem without the use of expansions, therefore keeping the number of vertices and edges constant along sequences of moves witnessing an isomorphism between two groups. We further show that the isomorphism problem for a large family of cyclic JSJ decompositions reduces to the case of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS), and that among GBSs, it suffices to consider one-vertex graphs. As an application of the methods, we solve the isomorphism problem for a broad class of flexible GBSs. Finally, we discuss potential further applications of our techniques.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> 
 We prove that the isomorphism problem is decidable for generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups  with one quasi-conjugacy class and full support gaps. In order to do so we introduce a family of invariants that fully characterize the isomorphism within this class of GBSs.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary> 
 We introduce a new isomorphism invariant for generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS), the limit angle. This invariant has a geometric interpretation that displays a qualitatively new dynamics, and it is completely different from any previously known isomorphism invariant. We apply this invariant to classify GBSs with one vertex and two edges.
