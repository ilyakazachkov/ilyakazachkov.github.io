Together with <a href="https://montsecasals.wixsite.com/montse" target="_blank">Montserrat Casals-Ruiz</a>  and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dario-ascari" target="_blank">Dario Ascari</a> we study graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups, their group of automorsphims as well as the Isomorphism Problem including the Isomorphism Problem for GBSs. Here are some preprints:

<summary>Abstract</summary>
We describe the outer automorphism group of a one-ended fundamental group of a graph of groups, when edge groups are cyclic, and vertex groups are torsion-free with cyclic centralisers. We show that in this case the outer automorphism group is virtually built from the outer automorphisms of the vertex groups (fixing some elements), the outer automorphisms of some associated generalised Baumslag-Solitar groups, and generalised twists - partial conjugations by elements in the centralisers of some elliptic elements in the group

<summary>Abstract</summary> 
We introduce two new moves that can be applied to graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups. When solving the isomorphism problem, these moves allow us to avoid using expansions; in particular, the number of vertices and edges remains constant along sequences of moves. As a corollary, we describe the isomorphism problem for a family of very flexible generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups. We also show that the isomorphism problem for a large families of cyclic JSJ decompositions can be reduced to the case of GBSs. Moreover, among GBSs, the isomorphism problem is reduced to the case of one-vertex graphs. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our methods. 

We introduce two new moves on graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups that preserve the fundamental group. These moves allow us to address the isomorphism problem without the use of expansions, so keeping the number of vertices and edges constant along sequences of moves witnessing an isomorphism between two groups. We further show that the isomorphism problem for a large family of cyclic JSJ decompositions reduces to the GBS case, and that among GBS groups, it suffices to consider one-vertex graphs. As an application of the methods, we solve the isomorphism problem for a broad class of flexible generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups.
